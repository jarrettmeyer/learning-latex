Here it is, everyone. The moment you've been waiting for. This is my very first equation in \LaTeX. I know, I know. You're so excited you can barely contain yourself.

Given three sides of a right triangle -- $a$, $b$, and $c$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse -- the Pythagorean theorem is defined by the following equation

\begin{align}
	a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{align}
